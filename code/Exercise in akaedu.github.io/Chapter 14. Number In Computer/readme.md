# 1. Why computer using binary cout number ?
	1. Decimal, Binary, Bit;
	2. 1-bit Full Adder;
	3. Gate, Wire, Inverter, XOR, eXclusive OR;
	4. Carry, Ripple Carry Adder;
# 2. Conversation between different number format:
	1. MSB(Most Significant Bit), LSB(Least Significant Bit);
	2. Octal:
		(10_110_010)2 -> (262)8,
	3. Hexadecimal:
		(1011_0010)2  -> (B2)16.
# 3. Add and Sub of Integer in C:
	1. Sign and Magnitude: Sign Bit(0,+; 1,-) in MSB, the other 7 bit is the value;
	2. Overflow;
	3. 1's Complement;
	4. 2's Complement;
	5. Signed Number, Unsigned Number;
	6. Carry Flag, Over Flag, Zero Flag, Negative Flag;
	7. Overflow, Underflow;
# 4. Floating number
	0. Scientific Notation;
	1. Mantissa/Significand, Exponent, Radix;
	2. 1 bit sign bit, 5 bits exponent, 8 bits significand;
	3. Biased Exponent, Normalize, Implied;
	4. Significance Loss;
	5. IEEE(Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) IEEE 754
	6. C99 Rationale: 6.7.8:25: As far as the committee knows, all machines treat all bits zero as a representation of floating-point zero. But, all bits zero might not be the canonical representation of zero.
