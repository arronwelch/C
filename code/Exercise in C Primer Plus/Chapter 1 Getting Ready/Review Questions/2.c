/* Review Questions 1.2 */

// Explain the difference between a source code file, object code file, and executable file.

// A source code file contains code as written in whatever language the programmer is 
// using. An object code file contains machine language code; it need not be the code for a
// complete program. An executable file contains the complete code, in machine language,
// constituting an executable program.
