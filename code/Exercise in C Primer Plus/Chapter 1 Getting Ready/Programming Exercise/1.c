// Programming Exercise 1.1

// We don't expect you to write C code yet, so this exercise concentrates on the earlier stages
// of the programming process.

// You have just been employed by MacroMuscle, Inc. (Software for Hard Bodies). The
// company is entering the Europen market and wants a program that converts inches
// to centimeters (1 inch = 2.54 cm). The company wants the program set up so that it
// prompts the user to enter an inch value. Your assignment is to define the program
// objectives and to design the program (steps 1 and 2 of the programming process).

// a. define the program objectives:
//    1. variables inch and cm.
//    2. prompts the user enter an inch value.
//    3. calculate the inch value to the cm value.
//    4. print the cm value.
