/* Review Questions 3.1 */

// Which data type would you use for each of the following kinds of data (sometimes more 
// than one type could be appropriate)?

// a. The population of East Simpleton
// b. The cost of a movie on DVD
// c. The most common letter in this chapter
// d. The number of times that the letter occurs in this chapter

// a. int, possibly short or unsigned or unsigned short; population is a whole number.
// b. float; it's unlikely the cost will be an exact integer.(You could use double but 
//    don't really need the extra precision.)
// c. char.
// d. int, possibly unsigned.
