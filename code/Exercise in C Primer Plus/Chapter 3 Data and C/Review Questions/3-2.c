/* Review Questions 3.2 */

// Why would you use a type long variable instead of type int?

// One reason is that long may accommodate larger numbers than int on your system;
// another reason is that if you do need to handle larger values, you improve portability by
// using a type guaranteed to be at least 32 bits on all systems.
